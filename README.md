    abstract: >
        Deflategate is a NFL controversy regarding New England Patriots tampering with footballs used in the American
        Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game. I have built a sentiment analysis model to process tweets regarding
        an American Football scandal, deflategate, and get the public sentiment for the whole ordeal. The model also does
        context based sentiment analysis to answer the specific questions regarding blame and support for each context. I
        have chosen three contexts, Patriots, Tom Brady and Management, to scrutinize the scandal. These contexts cover the
        entire breadth of the scandal as it incorporates the key points of the scandal. The model also calculates the overal
        l criticism and support shown by people. The model classifies sentiment using Naïve Bayes Classifier.

    key questions: >
        1. Whether the general public concerned about deflated balls? 
        2. What was the public sentiment towards various contexts like Patriots or their star player Tom Brady?
        3. Check if there was a decline in popularity of club and players after the scandal?
