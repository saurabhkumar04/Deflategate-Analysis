# Deflategate-Analysis
This project implements a sentiment analysis model to process tweets regarding an American Football scandal, deflategate, and get the public sentiment for the whole ordeal. The model also does context based sentiment analysis to answer the specific questions regarding blame and support for each context. I have chosen three contexts, Patriots, Tom Brady and Management, to scrutinize the scandal. These contexts cover the entire breadth of the scandal as it incorporates the key points of the scandal. The model also calculates the overall criticism and support shown by people. The model classifies sentiment using Na√Øve Bayes Classifier.
